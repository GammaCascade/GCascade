# GCascade
gamma-ray propagation package for Wolfram Mathematica

To use GCascade dowload the .wl and .nb files and place them in the same directory as the libraries folder.

NOTE: Decompressing the 7zip files will produce a single directory titled "Libraries". Inside this directory, there is a set of .csv files needed to run CCascade.
