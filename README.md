# GCascade
gamma-ray propagation package for Wolfram Mathematica

As of June 6, 2018 a new version of GCascade is available for download, GCascadeV2. Version two drastically improves accuracy at energies below around one PeV. New Libraries have also been created for this version.

To use GCascade dowload the .wl and .nb files and place them in the same directory as the libraries folder.

NOTE: Decompressing the 7zip files will produce a single directory titled "LibrariesV2". Inside this directory, there is a set of .csv files needed to run GCascade.
